A very warm welcome to the **Polytechnic Forum (PF) 2023**!

An initiative which started in 1996, PF provides a platform for polytechnic students to gain a deeper understanding of important national issues through a series of engaging programmes. This year’s forum will be organised as part of the inaugural [Singapore Young Leaders Programme](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20230530-lee-kuan-yew-centennial-fund-launched-to-support-about-2000-students-annually-through-scholarships-and-programmes), which brings together student leaders like yourselves, to participate in exciting activities that will develop and hone your leadership skills.&nbsp;

It is always a pleasure to witness this gathering of bright young minds from all walks of life, who are eager to ignite change, inspire action, and ideate solutions that will shape their futures. In a world that is facing unprecedented sustainability challenges, PF also presents an opportune conduit for you to be a symbolic part of Singapore’s move towards a greener, brighter and more sustainable future. Resonant with this spirit, the theme for this year’s forum will hence be **“Our Green SG”**.

Sustainability has always been an integral tenet of our Singapore story. In our formative years, even as we provided basic necessities for our people, we did so with “sustainable development” in mind, long before the concept gained prominence. Today, the notion of a sustainable Singapore is not merely a buzzword; it is a call-to-action that demands attention. Your ideas, enthusiasm and passion will hence be the driving force behind the transformative change we seek, as we work collaboratively to address the pressing sustainability issues of our time.

As we stand at the crossroads of opportunity and responsibility today, you will realise that all our actions will impact the trajectory of our planet's future. Sustainability must hence be woven into the fabric of our daily lives, influencing our choices as consumers, citizens and leaders. Paying testimony to the adage “Change is the only constant”, the COVID-19 pandemic has also reminded us of our fragile existence, but at the same time, highlighted the power of humankind’s ability to adapt and evolve.&nbsp;This, is exactly the ethos that should underpin your learning experience at PF 2023.

In this forum, you will explore the following sub-themes through a carefully curated ensemble of activities – including peer discussions, learning journeys, talks, as well as engagements with government and industry leaders:

* Green Economy
* Green Resources
* Sustainable Living
* Resilient Future

Over the course of PF 2023, I encourage all of you to think boldly, engage in meaningful discourse, challenge the status quo, and propose innovative solutions. Remember to make friends, collaborate and learn too, while embracing your fellow participants’ colourful diversities and unique differences. Above all, I also hope the skills honed, networks gained, and insights uncovered along this journey will remain with you for life, long after your PF chapter has closed.

I wish you all an enriching and fruitful experience. Have fun and happy ideating!

Warmest Regards,<br>
Mr Paul Yap<br>
