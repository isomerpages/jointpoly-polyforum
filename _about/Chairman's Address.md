			<td><p>A very warm welcome to the <b>Polytechnic Forum (PF) 2023</b>!<br><br>Since 1996, PF has been providing a platform for polytechnic students to gain a deeper understanding of important national issues.

In a world that is facing unprecedented sustainability challenges, PF 2023 presents a valuable opportunity for you to have your say in Singapore’s move towards a greener, brighter and more sustainable future. This year’s theme – **“Our Green SG”** – invites you to dream and envision together with your peers on what your green Singapore can look like and how we can get there.

In this forum, you will explore this theme through a thoughtfully curated ensemble of activities – including peer discussions, learning journeys, talks, as well as engagements with government and industry leaders:

I encourage all of you to think boldly, engage in meaningful discussions, challenge the status quo, and propose innovative solutions during this forum. Remember also to make friends, collaborate, and embrace your fellow participants’ diversities and unique differences. Above all, I hope the skills honed, networks gained, and insights uncovered along this journey will remain with you for life, long after your PF chapter has closed.

I wish you all an enriching and fruitful PF experience. Have fun and happy ideating!

Warmest Regards,<br>
Mr Paul Yap<br>
Chairman, Polytechnic Forum 2023<br>
Director, Student Development &amp; Alumni Affairs<br>
