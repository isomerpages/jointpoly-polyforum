<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Polytechnic Forum 2024, themed “Total Defence”!<br></strong>

greetings to each of you. This forum represents a significant opportunity
for us to come together and explore a theme that is vital to our collective
future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year’s theme encapsulates a broad and inclusive approach to security
and resilience, emphasizing both physical protection and the strengthening
of our society, economy, and institutions. Our goal is to delve into these
aspects, generate deeper discussions, and inspire participants to be change
agents who contribute to a more secure and cohesive future.</p>

the driving forces behind this forum. We encourage you to engage wholeheartedly
with the sessions and workshops, challenge assumptions, and collaborate

supportive environment for our students is greatly appreciated. We value

every aspect of this forum has not gone unnoticed. Thank you for your commitment

<p>To our esteemed partners: Your support and collaboration are crucial to
the success of this forum. We are grateful for your partnership and for

of you to take full advantage of this opportunity. Share your insights,
participate actively, and collaborate openly. Let us work together to deepen
our understanding of “Total Defence” and develop action plans that will
drive positive change.</p>
