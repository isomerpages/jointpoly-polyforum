<p>Dear Student Participants, Staff Facilitators, Partners, and Organisers,</p>
<p>Welcome to Polytechnic Forum 2025!</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to all of you to this
year’s Polytechnic Forum.</p>
<p>This year’s Forum, themed <strong>“Our Home Our Singapore,”</strong> marks
a significant milestone as we commemorate SG60, celebrating six decades
of Singapore’s nation-building journey. Since its inception in 1996, the
Forum has served as an important platform for young leaders to engage in
critical dialogues, broaden their perspectives, and contribute innovative
ideas for the future of our nation.</p>
<p>As we gather over the coming days, I encourage all student leaders to
approach this opportunity with curiosity, openness, and a strong sense
of responsibility. Through collaborative learning, meaningful discussions,
and reflective exploration, may this Forum inspire a deepened commitment
to shaping a Singapore that is inclusive, resilient, sustainable, and united.</p>
<p>To our facilitators, your guidance and mentorship play a vital role in
promoting insightful conversations and supporting our students’ development
and ideation.</p>
<p>To our partners for bringing their expertise to enrich our students' learning
experience and for affirming the importance of collaboration in shaping
Singapore’s future.</p>
<p>To our organising team, your meticulous preparation, unwavering commitment,
and behind-the-scenes efforts are crucial to the success of this Forum.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a rewarding and impactful Polytechnic Forum 2025.</p>
<p>Warm regards,
<br><strong>Evelynn Koh</strong>
<br>Organising Chairperson
<br>Polytechnic Forum 2025</p>
