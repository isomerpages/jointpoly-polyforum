<p>Dear Student Participants, Staff Facilitators, Organisers, and Partners,</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Polytechnic Forum 2024, themed “Total Defence”!<br></strong>
</p>
<p>I’m excited to extend a warm welcome to all participants, facilitators,
organisers, and partners. This year’s theme focuses on the importance of
security and resilience addressing not only physical protection but also
the strengthening of our society, economy, and institutions. To the student
participants: I encourage you to dive into the discussions, challenge assumptions,
and collaborate with your peers and mentors. This is your platform to explore
and contribute to meaningful conversations around “Total Defence.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>To our facilitators: I deeply appreciate your expertise and guidance,
which are essential to creating a supportive and engaging environment for
the students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To the organisers: Your dedication and attention to detail have been invaluable
in making this event possible. Thank you for all your hard work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To our partners: Your support and collaboration are crucial, and I’m grateful
for the resources and expertise you bring to the forum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we embark on this journey together, I encourage you all to actively
share your insights and collaborate to develop actionable plans for a more
secure and cohesive future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Wishing you a productive and inspiring experience at the Polytechnic Forum
2024!</p>
