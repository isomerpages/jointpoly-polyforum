<p>Originated in 1996, the annual Polytechnic Forum provides a platform for
polytechnic students to gain a deeper understanding of national issues
through the facilitation of activities and discussions with&nbsp;government
and industry leaders. It is hoped that the participants would embrace their
role as young Singaporeans as they glean meaningful insights from the discussions
and propose ideas on how youths can help shape the Singapore of the future.</p>
<p>The Polytechnic Forum 2024 is co-organised by five polytechnics, themed
'Total Defence,' to mark the 40th anniversary of Total Defence (TD40) in
Singapore. A total of 500 polytechnic students will converge over six days,
with the Pre-forum happening from Sep 25 to 27 and a residential component
at D’Resort happening from Sep 30 to Oct 2.</p>

<p>2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence (TD40) in Singapore, since it was
first introduced in 1984.&nbsp; The theme for this year’s Total Defence
campaign - “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” - focuses on the many ways
we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving hybrid threats
and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain
disruptions and food security that affect communities and Singaporeans'
way of life. Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to
ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises or disruptions, and that we
remain resilient and united.</p>
<p>The forum activities are curated to offer students meaningful engagement
opportunities that will help them to relate whole-of-government efforts
towards evolving threats and challenges to Singapore and understand the
relevance of Total Defence in today’s context. Horizontally, all participants
will be exposed to the importance of Military Defence through a visit to
an Army Camp. Vertically, the students will explore the following pillars
of Total Defence in their sub-theme groups - Civil Defence, Economic Defence,
Social Defence, Digital Defence, and Psychological Defence.</p>
