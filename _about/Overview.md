<p>Originated in 1996, the annual Polytechnic Forum provides a platform for
polytechnic students to gain a deeper understanding of national issues
through the facilitation of activities and discussions with&nbsp;government
and industry leaders. It is hoped that the participants would embrace their
role as young Singaporeans as they glean meaningful insights from the discussions
and propose ideas on how youths can help shape the Singapore of the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the familiar device of the speech bubble to communicate the purpose
of the forum, the logo builds upon the initials, P and F to create a monogram
that is easily identifiable, and as memorable as Polytechnic Forum. The
letterforms have been stylised to accommodate the speech bubbles in the
negative spaces of P and F, retaining legibility and at the same time creating
a distinct visual language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jointly organised by the five polytechnics in Singapore, this year’s main
sponsor is Tote Board.&nbsp;The pre-forum will take place from 25 to 27
September.&nbsp;The participants will continue to engage with the issues
during the residential programme from the 30 September to 2 October that
will be held at D Resort @ Downtown East.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Highlights of the six-day long forum activities include: a Total Defence
Quest where participants will learn more about the importance of each Defence
pillar through games and exploration activities at external venues, a Table-Top
Exercise, a visit to an Army Camp, tasting of Food Ration, a Panel Discussion
with distinguished speakers, Dialogues with Government officials, Learning
Journeys, Peer Sharing, bonding through social activities and a Community
Action Project where delegates will engage with residents at five community
venues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polytechnic Forum 2024 is hosted by Nanyang Polytechnic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence (TD40) in Singapore, since it was
first introduced in 1984.&nbsp;The theme for this year’s Total Defence
campaign - “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” - focuses on the many ways
we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving hybrid threats
and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain
disruptions and food security that affect communities and Singaporeans'
way of life. Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to
ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises or disruptions, and that we
remain resilient and united. &nbsp;</p>
