<p>Originated in 1996, the annual Polytechnic Forum has served as a valuable
platform for polytechnic students to deepen their understanding of national
issues through meaningful discussions, learning journeys and activities
with government and industry leaders. The forum inspires 500 student leaders
across the 5 polytechnics, encouraging them to embrace their roles as young
Singaporeans and contribute innovative ideas to shape Singapore’s future.</p>
<p>Since 2023, the Polytechnic Forum is part of the Singapore Young Leaders’
Programme, a Ministry of Education (MOE) leadership programme for Institutes
of Higher Learning student leaders, initiated from MOE’s Lee Kuan Yew memorial
celebrations in 2023. The programme aims to deepen student leaders' understanding
of Singapore’s governance and instil a sense of active citizenship and
leadership in society.</p>
<p>Singapore Polytechnic is hosting the Polytechnic Forum 2025. A total of
500 polytechnic students will converge over 6 days, with the pre-forum
happening on 12 Sep 2025 and a 5 day programme from 15 to 19 Sep 2025.</p>
<p>Polytechnic Forum 2025 serves as a platform for students to generate fresh
ideas, grounded in reflection and collaboration. Through this process,
they will envision their own hopes and ideas for Singapore’s future, one
that they can proudly call 'home', and explore how they can contribute
meaningfully to building a more united, resilient, and inclusive nation.</p>

<p>Singapore Polytechnic is hosting the Polytechnic Forum 2025, themed <strong>‘Our Home Our Singapore’</strong>.
Our theme is rooted in the spirit of SG60’s narrative and key message,
Building Our Singapore Together as we celebrate SG60, marking 6 decades
of nation-building. In addition, Polytechnic Forum 2025 will be branded
as a key event within the SG Youth Plan, which in turn is a fundamental
pillar of SG60. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The forum activities are curated to offer students meaningful engagement
opportunities that will help them to relate to issues pertinent to Singapore
currently, and how they can use Poly Forum 2025 as their sandbox to reimagine,
remix and rebuild our city state into the ‘Next-Gen’ city that they will
want to call “my home”.</p>
