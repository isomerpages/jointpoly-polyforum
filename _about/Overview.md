The **Polytechnic Forum (PF)**, an initiative which started in 1996, aims to provide a platform for polytechnic students to gain a deeper understanding of pertinent national issues through peer discussions, learning journeys, talks, and engagement with government and industry leaders. Organised annually, PF is a time where students gather to discuss, ideate, glean meaningful insights, and design action plans on important national issues, to help shape a better future for Singapore.

Sustainability is a vital part of our future! Singapore is facing several sustainability challenges today and these issues will continue to be a concern for young Singaporeans in the coming years. Companies and individuals are realising that the sustainability agenda cannot be mutually exclusive. In fact, they should work together to create a more sustainable world for all of us. It is therefore important for us to tackle problems together with stakeholders such as businesses, government agencies and community groups.<br>

In PF 2023, you will be exposed to both safe facilitation skills and mediation skills. These sessions will equip you with various collaboration skills, such as identifying and managing conflicts; handling difficult conversations; steps to accurate ground sensing; mediation techniques; agreeing to disagree; dealing with prejudice; and fostering collaborations, integration and inclusion, all within a safe space.

You will examine the sub-themes in PF 2023 from our local perspective as a city state, while being able to contrast the differences amidst our connections with ASEAN and global nations. These topics will be explored through panel discussions, learning journeys, experiential activities, constructive discussions, and self-reflection.

PF 2023 takes inspiration from the [Singapore Green Plan 2030](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/) and [Sustainable Singapore Blueprint](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/publications/sustainable-singapore-blueprint).
