<p>As Singapore works towards being a Smart Nation, digital technology will
pervade all aspects of how we live, work, and play. Singapore will be one
of the most technologically advanced, open and connected nations in the
world. While the digital revolution presents opportunities for Singapore,
it also makes us vulnerable to threats from the digital domain. These threats
will disrupt our way of life, and can also undermine our social cohesion
and strike at the confidence and psychological resilience of our people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We need to be able to respond to cyberattacks that target our networks
and infrastructure, as well as threats that can be perpetrated through
the digital domain such as fake news and scams. Singaporeans must recognise
that every individual is the first line of defence against threats from
the digital domain, so we can defend ourselves against such threats. We
must build robust defences and have effective recovery plans to remain
resilient even when things go wrong. This is what a strong Digital Defence
means.</p>
