<p>Economic Defence is about strengthening the competitiveness and attractiveness
of Singapore’s economy to keep Singapore relevant to the world, as this
is critical for our survival and success. It is also about keeping our
economy strong and resilient so that we can carry on and recover quickly
should we face crises like a global downturn or economic strangulation
that cripples our economic systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Food security is also a key component of Singapore’s Economic Defence.
As a small, trade-dependent nation, we cannot fully insulate ourselves
against food supply disruptions that could arise due to factors such as
climate change, disease outbreaks and geopolitical developments. The industry,
consumers and government all have a role to play in ensuring that we remain
resilient in the face of crises and disruptions to our food supply.</p>
