<p>Building a Singapore that supports families, balancing work and caregiving
needs across life stages.</p>
<p>In this sub-theme, students would have a better understanding of the diverse
challenges faced by different types of families in Singapore, and through
the dialogue with the speakers be able to reflect and create a more inclusive
and supportive environment for all families, ultimately contributing to
the goal of building a Singapore that is truly made for families.</p>
