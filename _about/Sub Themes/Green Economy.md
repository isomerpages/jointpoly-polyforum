What exactly is Green Economy? In short, it is an economic system aiming at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. It also prioritises use of renewable resources. Transitioning to a green economy is a no-brainer. It helps to protect the environment, mitigates impacts of climate change, and promotes using resources more efficiently.

So how does it affect you? To start, it promotes job opportunities, decent income and sustainable economic growth. Plus, it can contribute to improved health and overall quality of life. Singaporeâ€™s pivot to net zero will entail significant transformation in all facets of daily life, including the economy.
