<p>For a small country like Singapore, Military Defence is about building
a strong and formidable defence force that makes potential aggressors think
twice before attacking us. Effective deterrence is key in keeping Singapore
secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And if that fails, we must be able to defend ourselves when attacked.
The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) depends on National Servicemen to augment
its standing force of Regulars. Thus, the support of their families, employers,
and the community is crucial to keep the SAF operationally ready. When
the entire nation rallies behind the SAF, it gives strength to the nation
and provides the security and peace we enjoy.</p>
