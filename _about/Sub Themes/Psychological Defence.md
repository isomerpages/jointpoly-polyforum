<p>Singapore's ability to overcome threats and challenges that come our way
depends on the collective will of our people to defend our way of life,
the resolve to stand up for Singapore when pressured by forces that undermine
our national interests, and the fighting spirit to press on and overcome
crises together. This is aided by our understanding of Singaporeâ€™s history
and principles as well as the development of resilience and the strength
to recover swiftly after a crisis hits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This instinct is based upon a strong shared identity as Singaporeans,
pride in our nation, and an understanding of what we must do to ensure
our continued security, survival, and success. This is Psychological Defence.</p>
