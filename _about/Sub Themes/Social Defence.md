<p>Social Defence is about building understanding and trust amongst people
of all races and religions, and looking out for one another beyond self-interest,
so that we remain strong and united especially during times of national
crises. In a multiracial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society like
Singapore, peace and progress is possible only if Singaporeans of all races
and religions live together in harmony. Social Defence is about building
understanding and trust amongst people of all races and religions, and
looking out for one another beyond self-interest, so that we remain strong
and united especially during times of national crises.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It requires constant effort to build this trust among different communities
and to ensure that potential sources of misunderstanding and insensitivity
are nipped in the bud quickly.</p>
