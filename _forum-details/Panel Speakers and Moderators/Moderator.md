<p><strong>Ms Doris Nga, Senior Specialist at the School of Life Skills &amp; Communication, Singapore Polytechnic</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>With a post-graduate degree in mass communication, Doris spent over a
decade in the creative industry as a creative director and an account director
before joining Singapore Polytechnic as a lecturer in 1991.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days, when she is not teaching, she designs and delivers training
for corporate executives, educators, and student leaders. With over 15
years of facilitation experience, she developed the <em>Learning Facilitation Framework</em> â€“
a codified facilitation process that helps educators engage students and
facilitate their lessons more effectively. Her action research paper, <em>Igniting Student Engagement in the Classroom with the Learning Facilitation Framework</em>,
co-authored with her team, will be featured at the Excellence in Education
&amp; Teaching Convention 2025 in October this year.&nbsp;</p>
