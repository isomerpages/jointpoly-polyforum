Temasek Polytechnic was proud to host the **Polytechnic Forum (PF) 2023** with the support of our poly counterparts - **Nanyang Polytechnic**, **Ngee Ann Polytechnic**, **Republic Polytechnic** and **Singapore Polytechnic**!&nbsp;

The theme for PF 2023 – **"Our Green SG”** – invited our students to dream and envision together with their peers on what our green Singapore can look like, and how we can get there. Participants explored this meaningful topic through four sub-themes – **Green Economy**, **Green Resources**, **Sustainable Living**, and **Resilient Future**. These explorations&nbsp;were complemented with a thoughtfully curated ensemble of activities – including peer discussions, learning journeys, talks, as well as engagements with government and industry leaders.

Be inspired by our students’ journey of sustainability, ideation and friendship through this video montage, documenting the key takeaways of their exciting PF experience!
