Temasek Polytechnic was proud to host the **Polytechnic Forum (PF) 2023** with the support of our poly counterparts - **Nanyang Polytechnic**, **Ngee Ann Polytechnic**, **Republic Polytechnic** and **Singapore Polytechnic**! 

The theme for PF 2023 – **"Our Green SG”** – invited our students to dream and envision together with their peers on what our green Singapore can look like, and how we can get there. Participants explored this meaningful topic through four sub-themes – **Green Economy**, **Green Resources**, **Sustainable Living**, and **Resilient Future**. These explorations were complemented with a thoughtfully curated ensemble of activities – including peer discussions, learning journeys, talks, as well as engagements with government and industry leaders.

Check out our students’ journey of sustainability, ideation and friendship through the video montage below!

We hope everyone had an insightful, enriching and fruitful experience at **#PolyForum2023**. Till the next edition in 2024!
