<p>What exactly is <strong>Green Economy</strong>? In short, it is an economic
system that is aimed at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.
It also prioritises the use of renewable resources. Transitioning to a
green economy is a no-brainer. It helps to protect the environment, mitigate
the impact of climate change, and promote the use of resources in a more
efficient manner.</p>
<p>So how does it affect you? To start, it promotes job opportunities, decent
income and sustainable economic growth. Plus, it can contribute to improved
health and overall quality of life. Singapore’s pivot to net zero will
entail significant transformation in all facets of daily life, including
the economy.</p>

<h3><strong>Green Resources</strong></h3>

</p>
<p><strong>Green Resources</strong> refer to natural resources that are renewable,
non-polluting, and have a low impact on the environment. Some examples
of green resources are solar, wind, hydro power, rainwater harvesting,
recycled materials, sustainable agriculture, and reforestation. These resources
are considered "green" because they offer a more environmentally friendly
and sustainable alternative to traditional, non-renewable resources such
as fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The fact is if we do not transition to the use of green resources, some
consequences include climate change, environmental degradation, resource
depletion and health impacts. All of which are already happening at an
alarming rate. Reducing dependence on non-renewable resources hence requires
conviction and a mindset change.</p>

<h3><strong>Sustainable Living</strong></h3>

<p>The Government’s efforts alone, through policies, are not sufficient for
Singapore to achieve the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals</a>&nbsp;net
zero by 2050. The choices we make today will either positively or negatively
affect Singapore’s&nbsp;social compact.</p>
<p>For instance, taking public transport can help reduce our national carbon
footprint. Raising carbon taxes could mean higher electricity bills for
households. We are all stakeholders in this collective effort for <strong>Sustainable Living</strong>.
How many sustainability habits are you already practising?</p>
<p><strong><em>How prepared are you to play your part to help Singapore achieve sustainable living?</em></strong>

<h3><strong>Resilient Future</strong></h3>

</p>
<p>Faced with an ever-changing global stage, increasing global temperatures,
rising sea levels, supply chain disruptions and crises of every nature
possible, the Singapore government is keenly aware of the need to adapt
and evolve in the face of change.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/young-people-hold-the-key-to-creating-a-better-future" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a>,
young people like yourselves, hold the key to creating a better and more <strong>Resilient Future</strong>.
You are the most affected by the crises facing the world, and yet you are
also the ones with the most innovative ideas to build a better society
for tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong><em>How ready are you to participate in sustainability-related industries to create a resilient future for Singapore?</em></strong>
