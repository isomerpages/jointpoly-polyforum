<p>For a small country like Singapore, Military Defence is about building
a strong and formidable defence force that makes potential aggressors think
twice before attacking us. Effective deterrence is key in keeping Singapore
secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And if that fails, we must be able to defend ourselves when attacked.
The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) depends on National Servicemen to augment
its standing force of Regulars. Thus, the support of their families, employers,
and the community is crucial to keep the SAF operationally ready. When
the entire nation rallies behind the SAF, it gives strength to the nation
and provides the security and peace we enjoy.</p>

<p>Civil Defence is about being alert to signs of threats and being effective
first responders when a crisis occurs, helping one another regardless of
race, religion or background, so that Singapore can bounce back quickly
as one people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we are faced with a threat, or when a crisis hits us, the government
agencies' top priority will be to spare no effort in dealing with the threat
and responding to the crisis. However, their resources will be strained,
and they cannot be everywhere all the time. Singaporeans – whether at the
individual, organisation or community level – must pitch in to help and
be able to take care of themselves. We can be alert to signs of threats
and, when a crisis occurs, we can be effective first responders, helping
one another regardless of race, religion, or self-interest. It also helps
when we know whom to call, where to go, and what to do in an emergency.
All this helps us bounce back quickly as one people, confident and strong.
This is what a strong Civil Defence means.</p>

<p>Economic Defence is about strengthening the competitiveness and attractiveness
of Singapore’s economy to keep Singapore relevant to the world, as this
is critical for our survival and success. It is also about keeping our
economy strong and resilient so that we can carry on and recover quickly
should we face crises like a global downturn or economic strangulation
that cripples our economic systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Food security is also a key component of Singapore’s Economic Defence.
As a small, trade-dependent nation, we cannot fully insulate ourselves
against food supply disruptions that could arise due to factors such as
climate change, disease outbreaks and geopolitical developments. The industry,
consumers and government all have a role to play in ensuring that we remain
resilient in the face of crises and disruptions to our food supply.</p>

<p>Social Defence is about building understanding and trust amongst people
of all races and religions, and looking out for one another beyond self-interest,
so that we remain strong and united especially during times of national
crises. In a multiracial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society like
Singapore, peace and progress is possible only if Singaporeans of all races
and religions live together in harmony. Social Defence is about building
understanding and trust amongst people of all races and religions, and
looking out for one another beyond self-interest, so that we remain strong
and united especially during times of national crises.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It requires constant effort to build this trust among different communities
and to ensure that potential sources of misunderstanding and insensitivity
are nipped in the bud quickly.</p>

<p>As Singapore works towards being a Smart Nation, digital technology will
pervade all aspects of how we live, work, and play. Singapore will be one
of the most technologically advanced, open and connected nations in the
world. While the digital revolution presents opportunities for Singapore,
it also makes us vulnerable to threats from the digital domain. These threats
will disrupt our way of life. They can also undermine our social cohesion
and strike at the confidence and psychological resilience of our people.
We need to be able to respond to cyberattacks that target our networks
and infrastructure, as well as threats that can be perpetrated through
the digital domain such as fake news and scams. Singaporeans must recognise
that every individual is the first line of defence against threats from
the digital domain, so we can defend ourselves against such threats. We
must build robust defences and have effective recovery plans to remain
resilient even when things go wrong. This is what a strong Digital Defence
means.</p>

<p>Singapore's ability to overcome threats and challenges that come our way
depends on the collective will of our people to defend our way of life,
the resolve to stand up for Singapore when pressured by forces that undermine
our national interests, and the fighting spirit to press on and overcome
crises together. This is aided by our understanding of Singapore’s history
and principles as well as the development of resilience and the strength
to recover swiftly after a crisis hits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This instinct is based upon a strong shared identity as Singaporeans,
pride in our nation, and an understanding of what we must do to ensure
our continued security, survival, and success. This is Psychological Defence.</p>
