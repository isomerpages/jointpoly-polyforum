The Polytechnic Forum (PF) 2023 presents an opportunity for you to create a positive impact on our environment!

As part of this immersive experience, you are required to bring along recyclable materials to the Residential Programme (20-22 September 2023). With your creative touch, you will craft **a minimum of two usable** items or souvenirs for your fellow participants. These personalised creations will not only showcase your artistic talents, but also stand as powerful symbols of your dedication to the PF 2023 theme – **"Our Green SG**”.

Let your creativity and passion for a greener future shine at PF 2023! Together, we can inspire change, leave a lasting impact, and create a better and more sustainable world for generations to come. Let's take action and be the change-makers we want to see.

_(For more information on this activity, including examples of the recyclable materials that you can bring as well as guidelines on how to create your souvenirs, please refer to the **PF 2023 e-Handbook**.)._
