You can also check out the respective sub-groups that you have been assigned to, forum etiquette, administrative reminders (e.g. daily dress code, local/overseas packing lists), IT matters (e.g. how to connect to TP’s WiFi network), immigration clearance and protocols, as well as important contacts for PF-related or emergency needs.
