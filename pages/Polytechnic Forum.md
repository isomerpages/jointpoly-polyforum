The Polytechnic Forum, an initiative which started in 1996, aims to provide a platform for polytechnic students to gain a deeper understanding of national issues through discussions and engagement with government and industry leaders. It is hoped that the participants will embrace their role as young Singaporeans as they glean meaningful insights from the discussions and propose ideas on how youths can help shape the Singapore of the future.

According to the round-robin arrangement among polytechnics, RP will be chairing and organizing the Polytechnic Forum in 2022.&nbsp; PF2020 had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and NP had proposed to remain as organizer for PF2021 where the forum was eventually conducted entirely online.

Considering the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation, PF 2022 would be organized as a local, non-residential program. The pre-forum will take place from 9th September at Singapore Discovery Centre and the main programme will be from 13th to 16th September at Republic Polytechnic.

# Building a Caring Nation - One People, One Nation?

COVID-19 has thrown up many fault lines within the Singapore society. Taking a leaf from our pledge, “We the citizens of Singapore pledge ourselves as one united people regardless of race language or religion…. Based on justice and equality…. Achieve happiness prosperity and progress for our nation”, the forum will examine what the pledge means to Singaporeans and whether we have stayed true it.

The theme keeps in line with Minister Ong Ye Kung’s recent speech at Singapore Perspectives 2022 where he shared, “This makes nation building a long term, subconscious process. A nations’ people will need to have common experiences, and go through trials and tribulations together. Over time, this togetherness will forge common ideals that transcend primordial tribal instincts, and overcome forces that deepen social fault lines.” He went on to say, “That the consistent strengths of the institutions of state will always strive to ensure justice and fairness to all, uphold meritocracy, bring out the best of people, bridge our divides and put us on the right path for the long term.”
