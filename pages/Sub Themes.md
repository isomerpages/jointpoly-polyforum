In PF 2023, participants will be exposed to both safe facilitation skills and mediation skills. These sessions will equip you with various collaboration skills, such as identifying and managing conflicts; handling difficult conversations; steps to accurate ground sensing; mediation techniques; agreeing to disagree; dealing with prejudice; and fostering collaborations, integration and inclusion, all within a safe space.

You will examine the sub-themes in PF 2023 from our local perspective as a city state, while being able to contrast the differences amidst our connections with ASEAN and global nations. These topics will be explored through panel discussions, learning journeys, experiential activities, constructive discussions, and self-reflection.
