<p>Temasek Polytechnic was proud to host the <strong>Polytechnic Forum (PF) 2023</strong> with
the support of our poly counterparts - <strong>Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>, <strong>Ngee Ann Polytechnic</strong>, <strong>Republic Polytechnic</strong> and <strong>Singapore Polytechnic</strong>!&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The theme for PF 2023 – <strong>"Our Green SG”</strong> – invited our students
to dream and envision together with their peers on what our green Singapore
can look like, and how we can get there. Participants explored this meaningful
topic through four sub-themes – <strong>Green Economy</strong>, <strong>Green Resources</strong>, <strong>Sustainable Living</strong>,
and <strong>Resilient Future</strong>. These explorations&amp;nbsp;were
complemented with a thoughtfully curated ensemble of activities – including
peer discussions, learning journeys, talks, as well as engagements with
government and industry leaders.</p>
<p>Be inspired by our students’ journey of sustainability, learning and collaboration
through this video, which documents the key takeaways of their exciting
PF experience!</p>
