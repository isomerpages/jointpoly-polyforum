The Polytechnic Forum, an initiative which started in 1996, aims to provide a platform for polytechnic students to gain a deeper understanding of national issues through discussions and engagement with government and industry leaders. It is hoped that the participants will embrace their role as young Singaporeans as they glean meaningful insights from the discussions and propose ideas on how youths can help shape the Singapore of the future.

According to the round-robin arrangement among polytechnics, RP will be chairing and organizing the Polytechnic Forum in 2022.Â  PF2020 had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and NP had proposed to remain as organizer for PF2021 where the forum was eventually conducted entirely online.

Considering the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation, PF 2022 would be organized as a local, non-residential program. The pre-forum will take place from 9th September at Singapore Discovery Centre and the main programme will be from 13th to 16th September at Republic Polytechnic.
